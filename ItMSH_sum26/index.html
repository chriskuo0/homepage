<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> 
Microlocal sheaf theory originated in the study of partial differential equations. One key invariant of a pseudo-differential operator is its wave front set, introduced by H&ouml;rmander, which is a subset of the cotangent bundle that records not only the points of singularity but also the (co)directions of singularity at those points. In the algebraic approach to PDEs, initiated by Sato and later developed by Kashiwara and Schapira, the corresponding notion is the characteristic variety. The two later generalized this idea to arbitrary sheaves on manifolds, introducing the concept of microsupport, which is used to detect various properties of given sheaves. The notions of microsupport and a microlocalized version of sheaf-Hom then form the core tools of microlocal sheaf theory.

A major advancement came in the late 2000s with the discovery of deep applications to symplectic geometry. It had long been known that microlocal sheaf theory is closely connected to the subject. For instance, the microsupport of any sheaf is always coisotropic. However, in 2006 Nadler and Zaslow showed that sheaves can be used to compute objects in a version of the Fukaya category of the cotangent bundle. Shortly afterward, in 2008, Tamarkin proved non-displaceability results using microlocal sheaf theory; systematic results of this kind had previously been possible only via Floer theory. Since then, many further results intertwining the two fields, including applications to mirror symmetry, have been obtained, and the area continues to grow rapidly.
